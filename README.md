Using Wavelets and MCMC methods to analyze an aCGH data set

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a technique that, under certain conditions,
provides intense fluorescence signals which are used for detecting aberrations in DNA copy number.
We use an aCGH data set to illustrate how the MCMC methods discussed in my dissertation ("Bayesian 
estimation of dynamic mixture models by wavelets") can be effective in this kind of application.
